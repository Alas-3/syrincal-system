---------------------------------------------------------
for ADMIN side

(-goal here is to able to view pending/delivered products. overall statistics of the company. edit prices/deals/products. etc(to find out ig)-)

-polish up admin dashboard ui
-add tracking of products
    -view placed orders
    -view pending payments
    -view current inventory stock
    -improve assigning of product prices for different clients
(more yet to conceptualize)


----------------------------------------------------------
for CLIENT side

(-goal here is to become like foodpanda but for vet products-)

-improve client homepage ui/ux
    -find more e-commerce ui inspi
    -current ui/ux feels out dated

-link prices of products for client-specific users (i.e. diff clients have diff prices)
-integrate search feature
-fix filter chips
    -fix its ui
    -integrate its function

? take and add picture of products (around 500 products)
    -? find a better easier way thatll still be feasible and not tedious to integrate


+ managed to add functionality where it fetches the data for products and prices for specific clients
    - need to polish up by excluding or products with no prices for that client/user will no longer be displayed in the page to avoid not needed products for that specific client

-----------------------------------------------------------
MANAGER
-yet to be created
? possible change this for the role of the delivery men (i.e. like lazada to confirm products delivered when/where/who)
(conceptualize more)

-----------------------------------------------------------
for BACKEND
-create the table for prices of products specific to each client

-add paymongo(?) for payments

+ refactored supabase client to enable fetching of tailored products and prices based on account thats logged in



-------------------------------------- ! REMINDER ! --------------------------------------

Next order of business is to update the ui for the client dashboard first 
since we refactored it to connect the products and prices to different client accounts

NOTE: filter out duplicate data of products, and exclude ones without prices for that client
